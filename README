			scripts

This is my personal collection of Perl scripts. Several of
which extend the functionality of i3/sway using the module,
AnyEvent::I3 (i3-*), while others interface with a menu
program like `dmenu` to perform various tasks (dmenu-*).

Scripts:

	dmenu-file-picker	dmenu-based file manager
	dmenu-select-theme	personal theme configs	
	i3-clam-shell		manage laptop screens
	i3-cycle-focus		emulate 'alt-tab'
	i3-new-workspace	find next empty workspace
	i3-run-or-raise		focus if open, else launch
	i3-select-window	focus window with dmenu
	i3-title-status		status info in window title

Dependencies:

	AnyEvent::I3 (https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::I3)

Installation:

	git clone https://github.com/dhennigar/scripts
	cd i3-utils
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Documentation:

	Scripts are fully documented via POD in the source;
	documentation is accessible using `perldoc <script>`.
